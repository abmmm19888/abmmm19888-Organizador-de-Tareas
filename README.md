# Task Organizer

The `ToDoList.java` file implements a simple console application for managing a task list. Below are the features and functionality of the program:

## Features
- **Task Management**: Allows users to add, delete, view, and mark tasks as completed.
- **User Interface**: Console interface with a menu of options for interacting with the task list.
- **Temporary Storage**: Tasks are temporarily stored in memory during program execution.

## Functionality
1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
2. **Delete Task**: Allows users to remove a task based on its index in the list.
3. **View Tasks**: Displays all current tasks and their statuses.
4. **Mark Task as Done**: Users can mark a task as completed, adding the "[Done]" prefix to the corresponding task.
5. **Exit**: Ends the program execution and closes the application.

## Usage
To use the application, the user should execute the `ToDoList.java` file. Once launched, a menu with available options will be presented. The user selects an option by entering the corresponding number and follows the on-screen instructions to manage their tasks.

## Note
This program is a basic implementation and does not include data persistence, so tasks will be lost when the application is closed.
